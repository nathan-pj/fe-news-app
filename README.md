This React news app is built off the back end news API that I made.

### Back end

[Heroku](https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/)

[Github](https://github.com/nathan-pj/news-app)


To interact with my back end API, I created various endpoints to receive and send data as shown below:

See all available endpoints:

> GET "https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/"

Fetch all articles to display on the main page:

> GET "https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/articles/"

Fetch comments for the article with the _article_id_ of 32:

> GET "https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/articles/32/comments/"
