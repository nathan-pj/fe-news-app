This news app is built off the news API back end that I made:
Heroku - https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/
Github - https://github.com/nathan-pj/news-app

To interact with my back end API, I created various endpoints to receive and send data.

For example:

GET "https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/articles" - fetches all articles for me to display on the main page.

GET "https://news-app-npj.herokuapp.com/api/articles/32/comments" fetches the comments for article 32.

Visit the heroku link given above to see all available endpoints (/API)
